Instructions

The program is implemented in Java. It can be opened using any Java IDEs, such as
the IntelliJ IDEA, and selecting the folder "assignment3_fibonacciHeap".

The classes 'Node.java' and 'Wheels.java' are used for the wheel data structure.
The classes 'FibHeapNode.java' and 'FibonacciHeap.java' respectively are similar
to the classes previously mentioned but with added functions to implement the
Fibonacci Heap data structure.

The main class of the program is in the src folder and called 'heapRun.java'. It
is the runnable class of the program and will take as input the name or path of the text
file that will be used to execute the necessary operations.

To compile and run the program:

1. Open the 'assignment3_fibonacciHeap' folder in IntelliJ.

2. Click on the 'Build' menu and select 'Build project' to build and compile the
program.

3. Click on the 'Run' menu and click on 'Run...'. A pop up window will appear and
select 'heapRun', the main runnable class.

4. A command line window will appear on the bottom of the main window. A sentence
will appear asking the user to enter the name of the text file that will be used
output all the results of the search operations.

5. Write the name or path of the text file that is needed and press 'Enter'. For
the test file on the course web page, simply write 'heap0.txt' as there is a
copy of the text file in the program folder.

6. This should display all the results in the command line window.

Note:
The results obtained when testing with the 'heap0.txt' text file are incomplete.
The required output should consist of 10 values. However, the program is giving
only 8 out of the 10 values.
